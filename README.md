## REACT - Anton's Project Manager

> A ReactJS App that helps you manage your projects!

The project was create with `create-react-app`, following the instructions from [React JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ) on YouTube. You can find the instructor's source code from this repository, I think it's an amazing tutorial to start learning React:
